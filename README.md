# Lab 01 – Products, Architecture & Roles

To kickstart the course, you will explore two things:

1. How real software products may be structured;
2. What kind of engineers may build and operate them.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Use `GitHub` to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you'll need to:

- Set up your `GitHub` account and fork this repo.
- Pick an existing digital product.
- Study its architecture: components, data flow, deployment.
- Map components to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate some of the real-life engineering practices:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable;
- Come up with acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

## Submission checklist

As your proceed with the lab:

- Show your progress to the TA. TA will mark your progress.

By the end of the lab:

- Make sure that each task that you have completed has a corresponding issue linked to a PR.
- Close the issues for which all related activities are done.

## Repo structure

- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml) - an issue form for a task.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md) - a template for PRs.
- [`docs/diagrams`](./docs/diagrams) - diagrams of the product's architecture.
- [`.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) - `VS Code` settings.
- [`.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json) - recommended `VS Code` extensions.
- [`lab/appendix`](./lab/appendix) - Additional info.

## Tasks

## Time estimates

| Task      | Time             |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Lab setup | ~30 min          |
| Task 1    | ~30–40 min       |
| Task 2    | ~30–40 min       |

|           |                  |
| **Total** | **~2–2.5 hours** |

### Lab setup

First complete the [lab setup](./lab/setup.md).

### Required tasks

Follow the [procedure for each task](./lab/tasks/required/procedure.md) and complete all these tasks:

1. [Choose a product and study its architecture](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md#choose-a-product-and-study-its-architecture)
2. [Study tech roles involved in the chosen product](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md#study-tech-roles-involved-in-the-chosen-product)
3. [Compare your tech skills with the market needs](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md#compare-your-tech-skills-with-the-market-needs)

### Optional tasks

Complete one or more tasks below:

1. [Resolve a merge conflict](./lab/tasks/optional/task-1.md#resolve-a-merge-conflict).
2. [Add a CI check](./lab/tasks/optional/task-2.md#add-a-ci-check)
3. [Create a release](./lab/tasks/optional/task-3.md#create-a-release)
4. [Plan skill development](./lab/tasks/optional/task-4.md#plan-skill-development)

### Homework

- [ ] Read this [tutorial](https://hackmd.io/@aabounegm/SWP-git) to learn about `Git`, `Github`, and `Git` workflows.
- [ ] Practice on [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) (focus on merge/rebase and conflicts).
- [ ] Read about [`GitHub flow`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).
